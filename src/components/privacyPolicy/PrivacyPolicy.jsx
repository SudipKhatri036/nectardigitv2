          solutions for startups, SMEs, and budding young technopreneurs which

          <br />
          The establishing of Nectar Digit is the brainchild of a technically
          skilled young entrepreneur ‘Amrit Sparsha’ who doggedly labored hard
          in a highly competitive environment of digital companies growing by
          the day in the ancient capital of Kathmandu. His long-term vision,
          which came about through blood, sweat &amp; tears virtually, led to
          the founding of Nectar digit in the year 2018. Since then, there was
          no looking back.
